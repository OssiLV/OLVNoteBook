import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

In this lesson, we will learn about **two fundamental network models**:

1. **OSI Model**
2. **TCP/IP Protocol Suite**

---

## What is a Network Model?

Simply put, a **network model is a way to categorize and organize networking protocols**.

Each network protocol is a set of rules that define how devices communicate with each other — including how data is sent, received, and processed. For example:

- **Ethernet** is a network protocol.
- Standards for data transmission over **copper cables** or **fiber optics** also fall into this domain.

A protocol is not a physical standard but rather a **logical set of rules** — like a "language" that devices use to understand and communicate with each other.

---

### The Role of Network Models

You can think of a network model as a **map that categorizes different types of protocols**.
Each group of protocols is assigned to a specific "layer" — for example:

- **Physical Layer**: Handles the transmission of raw bits over physical media like cables or radio waves.
- **Network Layer**: Responsible for routing and forwarding packets across networks.
- **Transport Layer**: Ensures reliable data transmission, including error control and flow control.

These models help standardize protocols so that **devices from different vendors** can communicate in a consistent and interoperable manner.

---

### What Happens Without a Common Standard?

Imagine this:

- Dell creates its own unique network model with custom protocols.
- Apple (iMac) develops a completely different model.

\=> The result?

- Dell machines can only talk to other Dell machines.
- iMacs can only communicate with other iMacs.
- Dell and iMac? ❌ No communication possible!

In today’s world, where the **Internet connects everything globally**, this is clearly **unacceptable**.

We need **a universal standard** so that all devices can “speak the same language” — and that’s exactly why the **OSI model** and the **TCP/IP model** were created.

---
## What is the OSI Model?

The OSI model was developed by the **ISO – International Organization for Standardization**.

Time of creation: **late 1970s** to early **1980s**.

OSI stands for **Open Systems Interconnection**.

- "Open" means it is an **open standard** – meaning anyone or any company can implement it.
- It is **not a proprietary technology** created and owned by a single company.

<Aside>
    The OSI model was the **first major effort to standardize network communication**.
    Even though it is **no longer used directly** today, it remains:

    - **Highly important from a theoretical standpoint**.
    - A fundamental framework that **network engineers rely on to learn and analyze networks**.

    It serves as a conceptual backbone to help us understand how data “travels” from one computer to another.
</Aside>

### OSI is a Conceptual Model

The OSI model is **not a piece of software or hardware** — it's a **conceptual framework**.

It was created to standardize and categorize functions within a network system.

- This model helps developers, engineers, and hardware manufacturers understand the **role of each component** in the process of data transmission across a network.

### How Many Layers Does the OSI Model Have?

There are a total of **7 layers**, with each layer representing a specific set of network functions:

1. **Physical Layer**: Transmits raw physical signals over media such as cables or radio waves.
2. **Data Link Layer**: Ensures error-free data transfer between directly connected nodes, using MAC addresses.
3. **Network Layer**: Routes and forwards packets using IP addresses.
4. **Transport Layer**: Manages reliable data transmission, including segmentation and reassembly.
5. **Session Layer**: Establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions.
6. **Presentation Layer**: Translates and encodes data between application formats and network formats.
7. **Application Layer**: Interfaces directly with user applications and supports protocols like HTTP, HTTPS.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Layer 7">
        #### Layer 7 – Application Layer

        > The highest layer in the OSI model – Layer 7: the Application Layer.

        This is the **closest layer to the user**, as it directly interacts with the applications you use every day, such as:

        - Web browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Brave, ...
        - Email applications
        - Chat applications, etc.

        <Aside type="caution">
            Layer 7 is **not** the software itself (like Chrome), but rather the **communication protocols** that these apps use.
        </Aside>

        ##### What protocols operate at Layer 7?

        - **HTTP / HTTPS** – Protocols used by browsers to access websites.
        - **Example**: When you visit https://cisco.com, you're using HTTPS – a Layer 7 protocol.

        ##### How does Layer 7 work?

        Some of the main functions of this layer include:

        - **Identifying communication targets** – e.g., which server your computer will connect to.
        - **Synchronizing communication** – ensuring both parties understand and coordinate at the right time.

        **Example**: Imagine two computers want to communicate over a network:

        <Steps>
            1. On the left computer, you open a browser and enter a website address.

            2. The browser interacts with the Application Layer (Layer 7) and sends the data.

            3. That data travels down through each OSI layer, from Layer 7 to Layer 1.

            4. Each layer adds its own information to the data for specific purposes. This process is called:

                > **Encapsulation** – Packaging data

            5. Once it reaches Layer 1 (Physical Layer), the data is converted into electrical signals or light pulses and transmitted through cables.

            6. The other computer receives the signals, and the reverse process occurs:

                > **De-encapsulation** – Unpacking data

                Each layer strips off its corresponding information until the original data reaches the Application Layer on the receiving side.
        </Steps>

        <Aside>
            **Two types of interaction in the OSI model**

            - **Adjacent-layer interaction**:
                - Example: Layer 7 sends data to Layer 6, then Layer 6 to Layer 5, and so on.

            - **Same-layer interaction**:
                - Example: Application Layer on computer A exchanges information with the Application Layer on computer B.

            > It’s this **same-layer interaction** that allows two applications to "speak the same language" – e.g., a browser and a web server can communicate using HTTP/HTTPS.
        </Aside>
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Layer 6">
        #### Layer 6 – Presentation Layer

        After data passes through the Application Layer (Layer 7), it moves to the **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)** – this layer plays a key role in **“translating” data**.

        ##### So what does this layer actually "translate"?

        Imagine the following:

        - A web browser or app only understands data in its own way (called **application format**).
        - But to transmit that data over a network, it needs to be converted into **network format**.
        - And when receiving the data, the reverse must happen so the other machine can understand.

        > ➡️ That’s the job of the Presentation Layer.

        ##### A few concrete examples:

        - **Format conversion**:
            - E.g., converting image data from JPEG to another format, or text from Unicode to ASCII.
        - **Encryption & Decryption**:
            - When sending sensitive information (like passwords), this layer:
                - **Encrypts** the data before transmission – so it’s unreadable to eavesdroppers.
                - **Decrypts** it upon arrival – so the real recipient can understand.

        <Aside>
            ##### Summary of Layer 6's role:

            - Translates data between application and network formats
            - Converts formats between different software systems
            - Encrypts/decrypts data to ensure security

            > ➡️ In simple terms: if the Application Layer is the “communication brain,” then the Presentation Layer is the “interpreter” – making sure both sides understand each other even if they use different formats.
        </Aside>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Layer 5">
        #### Layer 5 – Session Layer

        The Session Layer is responsible for managing communication sessions between two devices or applications.

        Think of it like this:

        > When you open your browser (e.g., Chrome) and access YouTube, a **session** is established between your application and YouTube’s server.

        The Session Layer will:

        - **Establish** the communication session.
        - **Manage** the session during the entire data transmission.
        - **Terminate** the session once the task is complete.

        ##### A real-world example:

        Imagine millions of users are watching videos on YouTube. How does the YouTube server know:

        - Who is watching which video?
        - Which data belongs to which session?
        - When to disconnect a session?

        ➡️ That’s the job of the Session Layer — to distinguish and manage each **individual conversation**.

        <Aside>
            ##### In summary, Layer 5 is responsible for:

            - Establishing connections between two remote applications.
            - Synchronizing and maintaining session state between communicating devices.
            - Terminating sessions when completed or on error.
        </Aside>

        <Aside>
            Although the top layers (7, 6, 5) are crucial for understanding networking theory, in practice:

            - **Network engineers** don’t usually work directly with these layers.
            - **Application developers** are the ones who typically deal with them — building applications like browsers, video calls, etc.
        </Aside>

        <Aside type="caution">
            ##### Data Flow Sequence

            - After passing through the top 3 layers (**Application → Presentation → Session**), the data is sent to the **lower 4 layers (Transport → Network → Data Link → Physical)**.
            - Starting from Layer 4, each layer begins to add a **header** to prepare the data for network transmission.

            ➡️ Next comes **Layer 4 – Transport Layer**, which handles data segmentation, assigns port numbers, and ensures reliable delivery.
        </Aside>
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Layer 4">
        #### Layer 4 – Transport Layer

        The Transport Layer is responsible for **segmenting** and **reassembling** data to ensure reliable and efficient delivery between end devices.

        ##### Why segment data?

        Imagine you’re watching a video online.

        - If the video is sent as one huge chunk of data, even a tiny error could cause the entire video to fail.
        - But if it’s broken into smaller parts, a small error only affects a piece, and the video continues smoothly.

        Segmenting helps:

        - Increase reliability.
        - Reduce transmission risks.
        - Optimize bandwidth and performance.

        In addition to segmentation, the Transport Layer also handles:

        - **End-to-end communication**: ensuring data goes from the sender’s app to the correct app on the receiver’s device.
        - **Process-to-process communication**: e.g., your browser connecting to YouTube’s web service.

        <Aside type="caution">
            ##### Data Handling Process

            1. Data is prepared by the top 3 layers (**Application → Presentation → Session**).
            2. Layer 4 adds a special header — the **Layer 4 header**.
            3. At this point, the data + header is called a **segment**.

            **If the data is large**: It will be split into multiple segments, and each will get its own header for easier management.

            **After segmentation**: The segments are passed down to **Layer 3 – Network Layer** to continue their journey across the network.
        </Aside>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Layer 3">
        #### Layer 3 – Network Layer

        The Network Layer is responsible for connecting end hosts located on different networks—for example, from your home computer to a server in the U.S. via the Internet.

        ##### Key Functions of Layer 3:

        1. **Logical Addressing**
            - Layer 3 uses IP addresses to identify devices on the network.
            - These are addresses you often see, like 192.168.1.1 or 8.8.8.8.
            - 👉 IP addresses allow the sending and receiving devices to locate each other on a global network.

        2. **Path Selection / Routing**
            - Data doesn’t travel in a straight line from point A to point B.
            - There may be multiple routes through various intermediate devices.
            - Layer 3 selects the most optimal path (based on speed, cost, or reliability).
            - 👉 Routers perform this function and operate at Layer 3.

        <Aside type="caution">
            ##### Data Encapsulation Process

            1. Data is prepared by the upper layers (Application → Presentation → Session).
            2. The Transport Layer (Layer 4) adds its header, creating a **segment**.
            3. The Network Layer (Layer 3) adds its own header, including:
                - Source IP address
                - Destination IP address

            At this point, the data + Layer 4 header + Layer 3 header is called a **Packet**.
        </Aside>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Layer 2">
        #### Layer 2 – Data Link Layer

        Layer 2 is responsible for connecting and transferring data between adjacent devices, such as:
        - From a PC to a switch
        - From a switch to a router
        - From a router to another router (if directly connected)

        ##### What Does Layer 2 Do?

        1. **Node-to-Node Connectivity**

        Unlike Layer 3 (end-to-end connectivity across networks), Layer 2 handles data transfer between two directly connected devices.

        2. **Data Formatting for Physical Transmission**

        Since Layer 2 is just above Layer 1 (Physical Layer), it defines how data is formatted for transmission over physical media, such as:
            - Copper cables (UTP)
            - Fiber optic cables
            - Radio waves (Wi-Fi)

        3. **Error Detection and Correction**

            Layer 2 can detect errors that occur during data transmission over cables or waves (e.g., due to electromagnetic interference) and, in some cases, correct minor errors.

        4. **MAC Address Usage**

        - Layer 2 uses MAC addresses to identify devices. These are tied to the network interface card (NIC).

            ```txt
            00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E
            ```

        MAC addresses are distinct from IP addresses:
            - IP is like a home address on a map (changeable).
            - MAC is like a device’s serial number (unique, usually fixed).

        5. **Switches Operate at Layer 2**

            Switches are the primary devices at this layer. They read the destination MAC address in each packet to determine which port to forward it to.

        <Aside type="caution">
            ##### Data Encapsulation Process – Overview:

            <Steps>
                1. The Application Layer prepares the data.

                2. The Transport Layer (L4) adds its header → creates a **segment**.

                3. The Network Layer (L3) adds an IP header → creates a **packet**.

                4. The Data Link Layer (L2):
                    - Adds an L2 header (containing source and destination MAC addresses)
                    - Adds an L2 trailer (often a CRC for error checking)
            </Steps>

            At this stage, the entire structure is called a **Frame**.

            ##### Where Does the Data Go Next?

            The **Frame** is sent to Layer 1 (Physical Layer):
            - Converted into electrical signals over copper cables
            - Or radio waves for Wi-Fi

            → Sent to another device.
        </Aside>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Layer 1">
        #### Layer 1 – Physical Layer

        Layer 1 is the lowest layer in the OSI model, responsible for the actual physical transmission of signals between devices.

        Simply put:
        - 👉 This layer converts binary data (bits) into electrical signals (for wired connections) or radio waves (for Wi-Fi) for transmission.

        ##### What Does Layer 1 Define?

        This layer focuses on hardware and signal aspects:

        | Component                        | Role                                            |
        |---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
        | 🔌 **Voltage**                   | Which voltage levels represent bit 0 or bit 1   |
        | 📏 **Maximum Transmission Distance** | E.g., Cat5e Ethernet cables up to ~100 meters  |
        | 🔗 **Physical Connector Standards** | RJ45 ports, fiber optic ports, etc.            |
        | 🧵 **Cable Types & Characteristics** | UTP, STP, fiber optic, etc.                   |
        | 📶 **Transmission Signals**       | Electrical signals (wired), radio waves (wireless) |

        > Anything you can “see, touch, or measure” belongs to Layer 1.

        <Aside type="caution">
            ##### Data Transmission – From the Physical Layer

            When a device wants to send data:

            1. The frame is fully encapsulated by the upper layers (L2, L3, L4…).
            2. Layer 1 converts the frame into electrical signals or radio waves and sends it over the physical medium (e.g., cables or air).
            3. The data is transmitted to the receiving device (switch, router, PC…).
        </Aside>

        <Aside type="caution">
            ##### De-encapsulation Process

            When the receiving device gets the signal:

            1. Layer 1 converts the signal back into a bit stream.
            2. Layer 2 uses these bits to reconstruct the frame.
            3. Layer 2 removes its header/trailer → leaves a **packet** (L3).
            4. Layer 3 removes its header → leaves a **segment** (L4).
            5. Layer 4 removes its header → leaves the original data created by the Application Layer.

            > This is the **de-encapsulation** process—unpacking the layers to retrieve the original data.
        </Aside>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Protocol Data Units – What is a PDU?

Before moving forward, let’s review some key terms related to how data is prepared and sent over a network.

#### When an application starts sending data…

1. The application interacts with the Application Layer (Layer 7) → prepares data for transmission.
2. This data is gradually encapsulated as it moves down through each OSI layer below – with each layer adding its own “wrapper” called a header (and a trailer at Layer 2).

#### Key Terms to Remember

| OSI Layer               | When Header is Added                 | What is the Data Unit (PDU) Called? |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Layer 4 – Transport** | Adds TCP/UDP header                  | **Segment**                         |
| **Layer 3 – Network**   | Adds IP header                       | **Packet**                          |
| **Layer 2 – Data Link** | Adds MAC header + trailer            | **Frame**                           |
| **Layer 1 – Physical**  | Converts to electrical signals or waves | **Bit**                          |

#### So, What is a PDU?

A PDU (Protocol Data Unit) is the general term used to refer to the data unit at each network layer.

> For example:
> - Segment = PDU of the Transport Layer
> - Packet = PDU of the Network Layer
> - Frame = PDU of the Data Link Layer
> - Bit = PDU of the Physical Layer

👉 When you see the term “PDU,” remember it’s just the way we refer to the "data unit corresponding to each layer."
#### Summary of the Data Encapsulation Process

Imagine you’re sending a message:

1. The Application Layer creates the data.
2. The Transport Layer adds a TCP/UDP header → becomes a **Segment**.
3. The Network Layer adds an IP header → becomes a **Packet**.
4. The Data Link Layer adds a MAC header/trailer → becomes a **Frame**.
5. The Physical Layer converts the frame into bits and sends them over wires or waves.

➡️ This process is called **encapsulation** – “wrapping” the data through each layer.

#### Reverse Process – When Data is Received

When the receiving device gets the data, it does the opposite:

Bits → Frame → Packet → Segment → Original Data → This process is called **de-encapsulation** – “unwrapping” the data.

### Tips to Remember the 7 OSI Layers with Acronyms

#### From Layer 7 → Layer 1 (Top to Bottom)

Phrase: "All People Seem To Need Data Processing"

| Layer | Acronym    | Layer Name    |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| 7     | All        | Application   |
| 6     | People     | Presentation  |
| 5     | Seem       | Session       |
| 4     | To         | Transport     |
| 3     | Need       | Network       |
| 2     | Data       | Data Link     |
| 1     | Processing | Physical      |

⏬ This is the order in which data is encapsulated when sent.

#### From Layer 1 → Layer 7 (Bottom to Top)

Phrase: "Please Do Not Teach Students Pointless Acronyms"

| Layer | Acronym   | Layer Name    |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| 1     | Please    | Physical      |
| 2     | Do        | Data Link     |
| 3     | Not       | Network       |
| 4     | Teach     | Transport     |
| 5     | Students  | Session       |
| 6     | Pointless | Presentation  |
| 7     | Acronyms  | Application   |

⏫ This is the order in which data is processed when received.

## TCP/IP Model – The Practical Networking Model

After understanding the OSI model, let’s now explore a more practical and widely used model today: the TCP/IP model.

Like OSI, TCP/IP is a conceptual model consisting of a set of communication protocols that enable devices in a network to exchange data. However, there are some key differences:

- TCP/IP is used in the real-world Internet today.
- It has fewer layers than the OSI model.
- Most importantly, it’s not just theoretical—TCP/IP is the model that powers the Internet today.

### Origin of TCP/IP

TCP/IP was developed by the U.S. Department of Defense, specifically through DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency).

The two core protocols that form the foundation of this system are:

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** – a protocol for controlling data transmission.
- **IP (Internet Protocol)** – a protocol for network routing.

Hence, the model is named TCP/IP.

## OSI vs. TCP/IP: Do You Need to Learn Both?

- TCP/IP is the practical model used in today’s networks and the Internet.
- However, the OSI model remains crucial for deeply understanding how networks function and how their operations are divided into layers.
- In practice, network engineers often use the OSI model for troubleshooting, technical communication, or certifications (e.g., CCNA).

**In Summary**: OSI helps you understand deeply – TCP/IP helps you implement practically.

## Comparison of OSI and TCP/IP Models

### Layer Comparison

| **OSI Model**          | **TCP/IP Model**        |
|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Layer 7 – Application  | Layer 4 – Application   |
| Layer 6 – Presentation | *(merged into Application)* |
| Layer 5 – Session      | *(merged into Application)* |
| Layer 4 – Transport    | Layer 3 – Transport     |
| Layer 3 – Network      | Layer 2 – Internet      |
| Layer 2 – Data Link    | Layer 1 – Link          |
| Layer 1 – Physical     | *(merged into Link)*    |

> In the TCP/IP model, the top three OSI layers (Application, Presentation, Session) are combined into a single Application layer.
>
> The lower layers are fairly equivalent:

> - Transport (L4) remains the same.
> - OSI’s Network layer corresponds to TCP/IP’s Internet layer.
> - OSI’s Data Link and Physical layers are combined into TCP/IP’s Link layer.

### How People Talk in Practice

An important thing to remember: although we use the TCP/IP model to operate real networks, technical discussions often refer to OSI layer numbers.

**Example**:

- If a network engineer says:
> “There’s an issue at Layer 4”
  >
  > → They mean OSI Layer 4 (Transport layer),
  >
  > NOT TCP/IP’s Layer 4 (Application layer!).
- Similarly:
> “Layer 2 issue”
  >
  > → Refers to OSI’s Data Link layer, not TCP/IP’s Layer 2.

Therefore, you need to understand both models, especially OSI, to follow technical conversations, documentation, and certifications like CCNA.

### Variations in Terminology

In practice, some TCP/IP layers may have different names depending on the documentation or curriculum:

- The Link layer may be called:
- Network Access Layer
- Network Interface Layer

> Don’t worry too much about different naming conventions—understanding the meaning and function is what matters most.

### The 5-Layer TCP/IP Model (Common in Teaching)

A more common version of the TCP/IP model used in education is the 5-layer model, which separates the lower two layers:

| **TCP/IP 5-Layer Model** | **Corresponding OSI Layers** |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 5. Application           | OSI L5–L7 (combined)        |
| 4. Transport             | OSI Layer 4                 |
| 3. Network / Internet    | OSI Layer 3                 |
| 2. Data Link             | OSI Layer 2                 |
| 1. Physical              | OSI Layer 1                 |

Personally, I prefer this division because:

- It combines the higher layers, which network engineers rarely deal with directly.
- It keeps Data Link and Physical separate, as these layers have distinct roles in physical network operations.

## Simulation of Data Transmission from Host A to Host B

The diagram illustrates the process of Host A sending data to Host B, with two routers in between.

We have:

- Host A → Router 1 → Router 2 → Host B
- Each device has a TCP/IP stack (protocol stack).

> **Note**: The two routers only need to handle the lower layers, specifically the Internet layer (Layer 3) and the Link layer (Layer 2).
>
> They do not process data at the Application or Transport layers.

### Data Transmission Process from Host A to Host B

<Steps>
    1. An application on Host A wants to communicate with an application on Host B.

        **Example**: A Skype call – Host A sends video and audio data to Host B.

    2. Skype operates at the Application layer, and the data is encapsulated through the layers:

        - Transport (e.g., TCP/UDP)
        - Internet (IP)
        - Link (Ethernet)

    3. The data is then sent to the first router (typically via an Ethernet UTP cable).
</Steps>

### Role of Routers

- Routers operate at Layer 3 – the Internet Layer.
- They need to know the destination IP address to determine the data’s routing path.

**At each router**:

- The data is de-encapsulated at the Link layer.
- The router then reads the destination IP at the Internet layer.
- The data is re-encapsulated into a Frame and sent to the next router (e.g., via a long-distance fiber optic cable).

### Data Reception Process at Host B from Host A

<Steps>
    1. The data arrives at Host B, where the de-encapsulation process continues:

        - Link Layer: Removes header/trailer → leaves a **Packet**
        - Internet Layer: Removes IP header → leaves a **Segment**
        - Transport Layer: Removes TCP/UDP header → leaves the original data

    2. The data is finally delivered to the Skype application on Host B.

        **Result**: Skype on Host A successfully communicates with Skype on Host B → this is called process-to-process communication.
</Steps>

> This process is repeated multiple times in both directions throughout the Skype call.

## Concepts of Same-Layer Interaction and Host-to-Host Communication

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="same-layer interaction">
        #### Definition:

        **Same-layer interaction** refers to the **logical communication between corresponding layers** (with the same name) on two different devices in the TCP/IP or OSI model.

        **Example**:

        - The Application layer on Host A logically communicates with the Application layer on Host B.
        - The Transport layer on Host A logically communicates with the Transport layer on Host B.

        Although these layers **do not directly transmit data to each other**, they **communicate logically** through the processes of encapsulation and de-encapsulation.

        #### Specific Example:

        Suppose you’re making a Skype call from Computer A to Computer B:

        - The Application layer on Computer A generates data (video, audio).
        - This data is encapsulated through the Transport → Internet → Link layers.
        - When it reaches Computer B, the data is de-encapsulated layer by layer until it reaches the Application layer.
        - The Application layer on Computer B interprets the data as if it came **directly** from the Application layer on Computer A.

        This is **same-layer interaction**: logical communication between corresponding layers of two devices.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="host-to-host communication">
        #### Definition:

        **Host-to-host communication** is the process of **direct communication between two end devices (hosts)** in a network—typically computers, servers, or phones.

        In the TCP/IP model, the **Transport layer** is responsible for this type of communication. It ensures:

        - Data from the sending application reaches the correct application on the receiving end.
        - The sequence of packets is maintained correctly.
        - Error checking and retransmission if packets are lost.

        #### Specific Example:

        When you send a file from Computer A to Computer B over the Internet:

        - The Transport layer on Computer A encapsulates the data into segments.
        - These segments are sent through intermediate routers (which only handle IP at the Internet layer).
        - The Transport layer on Computer B receives the data, reassembles it in the correct order, checks for errors, and passes it to the Application layer.

        This is host-to-host communication—meaning the two hosts can communicate reliably and accurately, even across a complex network with multiple intermediaries.

## Protocol Standards Enable Communication Between Different Devices

A key point: TCP/IP protocols are industry standards used by all network device manufacturers.

→ This allows:

- An Apple iMac to communicate with
- A Cisco router, then to
- A Juniper router, then to
- A Dell PC

→ And everything works seamlessly.

This is the power of protocol standards—**interoperability**.
