import {Steps} from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

## Level 1 – Fundamental Basics (Essential Knowledge)

> Understand how computers communicate — the foundation for working with any system.

- **OSI Model** – The theoretical framework for understanding networking layers
- **IP Addressing (IPv4)** – How devices are identified and communicate
- **DNS** – Translates domain names to IP addresses

---

## Level 2 – Application Protocols

> Get familiar with protocols you use every day: web, file transfer, encryption.

- **HTTP/HTTPS** – The core protocol of the web and REST APIs
- **SSL/TLS** – Encrypts data; the foundation for HTTPS and secure services
- **FTP / SFTP** – File transfer protocols used in automation or file deployment

---

## Level 3 – Security & Access Control

> Knowledge needed to protect systems and filter legitimate traffic.

- **Firewall (iptables, Security Groups, NACL, etc.)**
- **IP Whitelist / Blacklist**
- **Port & Protocol Filtering** – For configuring on cloud or local servers

---

## Level 4 – Advanced Networking Systems

> Helps you understand how machines in a network get IPs, route traffic, and access the internet.

- **DHCP** – Automatically assigns IPs to servers/containers
- **Routing** – Directs packets between networks
- **NAT** – Translates IP addresses; important for Cloud & Kubernetes

---

## Level 5 – Advanced Applications & Integration

> For systems with high security or distributed architectures (e.g., microservices, multi-cloud).

- **Proxy (Forward/Reverse)** – Load balancing, caching, SSL termination
- **VPN** – Connects private networks over the internet; often used for internal access
- **Overlay Network (vxlan, flannel, calico)** – *Bonus*: used in Kubernetes networking

<Steps>
    1. **Stage 1**: OSI Model and IP Addressing provide the theoretical and practical foundation of networking. DNS is introduced early as it’s a core service in DevOps.

    2. **Stage 2**: HTTP/HTTPS, SSL/TLS, and FTP/SFTP focus on application-level protocols, helping you work with web services and file transfer.

    3. **Stage 3**: Firewalls and whitelists/blacklists relate to access control and system security.

    4. **Stage 4**: DHCP, routing, and NAT cover more advanced topics around managing and directing network traffic.

    5. **Stage 5**: Proxy and VPN require a solid understanding of all prior levels, and are typically used in more complex environments like microservices and cloud systems.
